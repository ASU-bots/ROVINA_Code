ROVINA_Code
===========

This code is the working code for Rovina, it used bitwise operations and was commented, albeit possibly poorly.

Make sure that the controller and Arduino have all of their grounds shared as well as the speed controllers have both a signal and a ground line to them.

This code has worked in the past and was submitted to a ChipKIT contest and won, this is how we have all of the chipKits for free.
